# Chebyshev
Chebyshev approximation of functions

This small project creates Chebyshev polynomials to any degree to approximate any (within reason) function
It generates C code in a text editor for easy copying to any project.

For now, the function and the domain are canned in the source, it is easy to change them at will.
